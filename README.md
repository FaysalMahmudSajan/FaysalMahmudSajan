## About Me
<p>
I am a Software Engineering student at Daffodil International University, focused on building practical AI systems that solve real-world problems.
My work centers around Machine Learning, LLM applications, and backend system development using Python and FastAPI.<br>
I have experience developing embedding-based applications, problem-solving with data structures and algorithms, and designing scalable AI-powered solutions.
I am continuously expanding my expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing while building hands-on projects that turn ideas into functional systems.
